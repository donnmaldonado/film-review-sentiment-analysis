# üé¨ Film Review Sentiment Analysis

## üìù Overview

This project applies **sentiment analysis** to IMDb film reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify reviews as **positive** or **negative**, helping stakeholders in the entertainment industry better understand viewer sentiment and inform data-driven decisions.

## üîç Objective

To compare the performance of various classification algorithms in identifying the sentiment of movie reviews, using vectorized text representations from Word2Vec.

## üìä Workflow

1. **Data Source**
   - IMDb movie reviews dataset (CSV format) from Kaggle.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Performed to identify data quality issues and distribution patterns.

3. **Data Cleaning**
   - Converted text to lowercase
   - Removed HTML tags, URLs, punctuation, emojis, digits, and stop words

4. **Text Vectorization**
   - Applied **Word2Vec** (Skip-gram) to convert textual reviews into 500-dimensional numeric vectors.

5. **Model Training**
   - Trained and tuned multiple classification models:
     - Logistic Regression
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Random Forest
     - Decision Tree
     - XGBoost
     - Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Used `GridSearchCV` for optimal model configurations.
   - Explored varying Word2Vec vector lengths to optimize performance.

## üèÜ Best Model

- ‚úÖ **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**
  - Architecture: Two hidden layers (sizes 100 and 200)
  - Performance: **F1-score = 0.8911**
  - Vectorization: Word2Vec with embedding size of 500
